What is HAMT?
======

HAMT is a new Heteroskedasticity Adjusted Multiple Testing procedure that avoids data reduction by standardization, and directly incorporates the side information from
the variances into the testing procedure. Our approach relies on an improved nonparametric empirical Bayes deconvolution estimator that offers a practical strategy for capturing the dependence between the inferential parameter of interest and the variance of the test statistic.
